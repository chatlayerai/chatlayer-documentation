# Entities

## Types of entities

There are four types of entities:

* **Match entity:** if the user states a word that is part of a predefined list or matches a certain pattern, this word will be detected as a match entity. _For example: "I want to know more about the **Premium** pack"_ ‚Üí _@product: Premium_ 
* **Contextual entity:** train your NLP so it can recognise entities that depend on the context of an expression. _For example: "Book a train ticket from **Brussels** to **Amsterdam"**_ ‚Üí _****@origin: Brussels, @destination: Amsterdam_ 
* **System entity:** these are entities that are pre-built into the platform and can be detected automatically. _For example: "My e-mail address is **ilovebots@chatlayer.ai"**_ ‚Üí _@sys.email: ilovebots@chatlayer.ai_ 
* **Composite entity:** a combination of different, but related entities _For example: "**Two** **fries** please"_ ‚Üí _@order consists of @sys.number \(2\) and @foodItem \(fries\)_

### When to use which entity type?

Use this handy flowchart so you can find out which type of entity best fits your use case:

All entities are only detected after you've **updated the NLP** at least once. Every time you change, add, or delete an entity, you should update the NLP again

## 1 ‚Äì Match entities

Match entities are a type of entity that is detected when the user states a word that is part of a predefined list, or matches a certain pattern.

### Option 1: Match text

Create a list of possible values for an entity. If a user mentions one of these values during their conversation with the bot, that value will automatically be saved as an entity.

For example: you have defined @product as a match entity, and have created three possible values: Basic, Intermediate, Premium. When a user says "I want to know more about the **Premium** pack", the entity @product will be saved, with the value "Premium".

Match entities are _case_ _insensitive_.

#### Synonyms

For each value, you can add a synonym that will be detected as the original value. Synonyms allow you to add alternatives to entities that are assigned to the same value. 

For example:

`I want to go to Brussels`

`I want to go to Bruxelles`

The meaning of the two expressions above is exactly the same, but you want to convert `Bruxelles` to `Brussels` so your bot can work with one and the same value.

### Option 2: Match pattern

Use a pattern to extract data from a user expression if it matches a particular format. Patterns are formed as regular expressions \(like in Python\). You can learn more about how to create regular expressions [here](https://regex101.com/).

For example: you have defined @customerID as a match entity, and have provided the following regex pattern: `[a-z]{5}[0-9]{2}`. This means that when a users says "My customer ID is **terwf33**", which consists of 5 letters and 2 numbers, it is saved as @customerID with the value "terwf33".

## 2 ‚Äì Contextual entities

Contextual entities use the principle of machine learning to identify entities that are used in sentences. They understand the entity by learning which type of word your entity is, where it's located in the sentence, and what the specific context is.

You can also add [synonyms](./#synonyms) to contextual entities.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contextual entities are the only type of entities that can \(and should be\) added to the expression itself, for example: "I want to book a train ticket from @origin to @destination"
{% endhint %}

You can see a live example of how you can use contextual entities in our tutorial here:

{% page-ref page="../../../tutorials/tutorial-getting-information-using-entities.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When adding contextual entity variables, there's no need to add capitalised and non-capitalised words. All text is decapitalized by the NLP before any recognition happens, so 'api' won't be recognised differently from 'API' ‚Äã
{% endhint %}

### Fuzzy matching for contextual entities

Fuzzy matching allows you to recognise a slight variation of an entity value \(or its synonym\) as the original value. For example "Brusselt" will be automatically corrected to "Brussels" if fuzzy matching is enabled.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28355%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Fuzzy matching is quite strict. Less than 20% of the characters are allowed to be different in order to link it to another entity. This is to avoid that the value is linked to another entity which also has overlap. 
{% endhint %}

## 3 ‚Äì System entities

System entities are entities that can be automatically extracted from the user's messages. You can use these to enrich your conversations and data integrations without having to configure custom entities yourself.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should never overwrite System Entities yourself ‚Äì they are automatically overwritten by the last detected value \(if any values are detected\). So instead, copy the System Entity variable to a variable of your own choosing outside the **sys** or **internal** namespaces.
{% endhint %}

### Supported system entities

Chatlayer.ai supports the following system entity types:

| Variable name | Example input by user | Example result in session |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sys.email` | "ilovebots@chatlayer.ai" | `sys: {email: 'ilovebots@chatlayer.ai'}` |
| `sys.phone_number` | "+32 487 23 02 03" | `sys: {phone_number: '(+32) 487230203'}` |
| `sys.ordinal` | "5th" | `sys: {ordinal: '5'}` |
| `sys.amount_of_money` | "5 euro" | `sys: {amount_of money: '5', amount_of_money_currency: 'EUR'}` |
| `sys.distance` | "5 kilometers" | `sys: {distance: '5', distance_unit: 'kilometre'}` |
| `sys.number` | "eighty eight" | `sys: {number: '88'}` |
| `sys.quantity` | "3 liters" | `sys: {quantity: '3', quantity_unit: 'litre'}` |
| `sys.temperature` | "80C" | `sys: {temperature '80', temperature_unit: 'celsius'` |
| `sys.time` | "3 pm tomorrow" | `sys: {time: '2020-12-25T15:00:00.000+00:00', time_grain: 'hour'}` |
| `sys.url` | "[www.chatlayer.ai/jobs](https://www.chatlayer.ai/jobs)" | `sys: {url: 'www.chatlayer.ai/jobs', url_domain: 'chatlayer.ai'}` |
| `sys.duration` | "3 hours" | `sys: {duration: '3', duration_unit: 'hour', duration_normalized: '10800', duration_normalized_unit: 'second'}` |

## 4 ‚Äì Composite entities

A Composite Entity is a combination of different, but related entities. This type of entity allows you to combine two separate entities into a single one.

For example: "**Two** **fries** please": _@order_ \(composite entity\) consists of _@sys.number:_ 2 \(system entity\) and _@foodItem_: fries \(match entity\)

## The difference between entities, variables, and values

**A value is a possible element of a variable or entity.** For example, the variable 'destination' can have the following values: Antwerp, London, Brussels, ...

**An entity that was successfully recognized by the NLP engine will be stored as a variable.** For example, say you created the match text entity 'Levels' with values 'Beginner', 'Intermediate' and 'Expert'. When the user says 'I think I'm an expert', the value 'expert' will be saved as a variable. So a variable is an entity that was successfully recognized and stored by the chatbot.

**Variables are pieces of information you know about the person talking to the bot.** For example, if someone is talking to the bot in English, we will remember their preference and save 'English' as a value for the variable ‚ÄúLanguage‚Äù. **Variables and values always appear in pairs.** They are stored on the user session that gathers all information about a user.

**Entities should only be used if their value is needed in the bot conversations**. For example, if your bot can help the user find information about a certain product and you need the name of that product to look up the information in a database, you should use entities. If your bot simply redirects to a web page with an overview of all products, you do not need entities.
