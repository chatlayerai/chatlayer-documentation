## Importing and exporting expressions

In the tab 'Expressions' you can import and export your NLP model easily.

When you click on the **Export** button, a dialog will open that allows you to choose which languages and intents you wish to export:

When you click on the **Import** button, a model opens that guides you through the steps of importing an NLP model. In the first step, you can download a template for your NLP import, and upload your filled-in version.

The second step lets you choose between **adding** to or **replacing** your existing NLP model. Be very careful with replacing your model, this cannot be undone!

## Importing and exporting entities

Our platform also allows you to import and export **entities**. If you go to the 'Entities' module under NLP, you can import and export the entity values and the synonyms for these values.

All entity types will be included in the export.
