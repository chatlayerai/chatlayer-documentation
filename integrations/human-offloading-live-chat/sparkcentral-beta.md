## Configure offloading

To transfer the conversation from the chatbot to a live agent in Sparkcentral, you can create an Action dialog containing a "send to offload provider" plugin. Configure the Sparkcentral offload provider.

Once this Action is triggered the conversation will be added to the Sparkcentral agent queue.
