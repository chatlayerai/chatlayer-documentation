# Freshdesk App integration

You can connect the Freshdesk app to Chatlayer by using an Action bot dialog. In the dialog, choose _Integration widget_, then under App, select _Freshdesk_ and click on 'Connect a new Freshdesk account'.

After clicking on “Connect new account”, you’ll see this pop-up:

You can find the Domain and API Key on your Freshdesk Profile page:

The part of the URL inside the green rectangle is your account’s Domain. The green rectangle on the right highlights your API key.

After you've entered this info and the connection is set up, you’ll be able to pick the action you want to perform within this dialog:

· Create ticket

· Add notes to a ticket (update ticket)

· Add replies to a ticket (send an email to the user)

· Create contact (create new user)

### **Gathering needed information**

You'll need to ask the user for the information needed to create a new ticket, like for example, their name. You can do so with an Input Validation dialog. By saving the user’s responses as variables, you'll be able to create a new ticket:

![Asking the user for their name](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (695).png>)

Next, your Actions could be as followed:

**1 – Create ticket**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (690).png>)

**2 – Add notes to a ticket**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (687).png>)

**3 – Add replies to a ticket**&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (679).png>)

**4 – Create a contact**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (681).png>)

&#x20;And that's it, your Freshdesk connection is set up and ready to go!
