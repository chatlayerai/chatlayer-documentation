![](../../.gitbook/assets/11)

You’ll see a new field to select integrations from:

![
](../../.gitbook/assets/12)

Choose Airtable

![](../../.gitbook/assets/13)

On the Airtable Account field, you’ll see the App that was created on step A, or you can create a new one by clicking the “Connect new account”:\
(If you create a new account from here, you’ll be asked the same information from Step A).

![
](../../.gitbook/assets/14)

And once you pick the integrated App that you already have or create a new one, you’ll see the “Select Action” field

![](../../.gitbook/assets/15)

You can Search, Create and Update records from your Airtable

![](../../.gitbook/assets/16)

Three new empty fields will appear in this screen. Here’s how you should fill them up:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/17)

You’ll get the information for the field “Base” from the Airtable URL. The URL syntax is:

https://airtable.com/**appXXXXXXX\[**_**use this for “Base”**_**]**/tblYYYYYY\[use this for “Table”]/… :

![](../../.gitbook/assets/18)

https://airtable.com/appXXXXXXX\[use this for “Base”]/**tblYYYYYY\[**_**use this for “Table”**_**]**/… :
