# 3. Media upload not working

A common question we receive at Support is how to add videos to the platform. Let's say, you have a great Youtube tutorial you want to show to your users, and want to add this to the bot. But when you add this to 'Media' in a Bot message, you see the following:

Not exactly what we are looking for, so let's fix that!



This article will explain how to use a Youtube video \(or any external video\) in your bot. 

## Get the embedded URL from the video.

You first need the embedded URL. In a Youtube video you can get this by rightclicking on the video and choose 'Copy embed code' like the screenshot below

## Action dialog

Then, create an action dialog and select `Iframe`

In the Iframe, past the `src` part of the previously embedded URL in the Source Input Box. For the video above, we need to change this:

```text
<iframe width="1280" height="786" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaYzSQn9rL4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```

To this:

```text
https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaYzSQn9rL4
```

Add that to the Action dialog, with a height that works for you. Let's start with 200 and see how that looks:

The end result in the bot is now the following:

Looks a lot better, don't you think?
