# 3. Media upload is not working

Let's say, you have a great Youtube tutorial that you want to show to your users. But when you try and add this to 'Media' in a Bot message, you see the following video:

Not exactly what we are looking for, so let's fix that!

## 1. Copy the video's embed code

First, you need to copy the embed code. Go to your Youtube video and right-click on it, then choose 'Copy embed code' like in the screenshot below:  


![Click on the 4th option to copy the embed code](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28528%29.png)

## 2. Create an Action dialog

Once you've copied the code, go back to the platform and create an action dialog. In that dialog, click on `IFrame` to create an Iframe.

![CLick on IFrame to create an IFrame](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28530%29.png)

In the IFrame, past the `src` part of the previously embedded URL in the Source Input Box. For the video above, we need to change this:

```text
<iframe width="1280" height="786" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaYzSQn9rL4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

To this:

```text
https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaYzSQn9rL4
```

Add this link to the Action dialog and set a height that works for you. Let's start with 200 and see how that looks:

Your bot will now display the video like this:

Looks a lot better!
