# Bot flows

## What are bot flows?

Unlike bot templates \(complete bots with an updated NLP and several use cases\) our bot flows are small components, designed for a specific use case. You can add such a bot flow to an existing bot to quickly add a new use case. 

These bot flows are use cases that our customers use a lot, so we wanted to to make it easy for you by having these flows ready to go! All you have to do is copy and past the bot dialogs in your own bot â€“ easy peasy!

## Which bot flows are there?

We're adding new bot flows regularly, so make sure to come back often. Below are the bot flows that you can already copy:

### Zendesk ticket creation flow

We wrote a [great article](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/integrations/human-offloading-live-chat/creating-a-zendesk-support-ticket) on how to create a Zendesk ticket integration, but how can your bot collect all those user details to create a ticket? Easy, just use the Zendesk ticket creation flow!

This flow allows your bot to collect user info needed to create a ticket using [input validation dialogs](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/bot-answers/dialog-state/user-input-bot-dialog), then confirms with the user if the information is correct before sending it to Zendesk. Just fill in your own Zendesk login details and off you go!
