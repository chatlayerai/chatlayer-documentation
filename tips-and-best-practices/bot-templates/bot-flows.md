# Bot flows

## What are bot flows?

Unlike our bot templates, which are complete bots with an updated NLP and several use cases, our bot flows are small components, designed for a specific use case. You can add these bot flows to an existing bot to quickly add a new use case or functionality. All you have to do is copy and past the bot dialogs in your own bot – easy peasy!

## Which bot flows are there?

We're adding new bot flows quite regularly, so make sure to keep an eye on this page. Below are the bot flows that you can already use in the platform today:

### 1 – Zendesk ticket creation flow

We wrote a [great article](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/integrations/human-offloading-live-chat/creating-a-zendesk-support-ticket) on how to create a Zendesk ticket integration, but how do you set up your bot so it can collect all those user details to create a ticket? Easy, just download the Zendesk ticket creation flow!

This flow allows your bot to collect user info needed to create a ticket using [input validation dialogs](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/bot-answers/dialog-state/user-input-bot-dialog), then confirms with the user if the information is correct before sending it to Zendesk. Just fill in your own Zendesk login details and off you go!
