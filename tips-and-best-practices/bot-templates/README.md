# Bot templates

When you create a new bot on the Chatlayer platform, you have two options to get started:

1. You build a bot from scratch
2. You start with a bot template and customise it for your business

If you build a bot from scratch, this page will help you get started: [https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LLTwFKMKb7nE4aFG5XD/s/-LLTwFwbOqJj4dDhg8Ju/tutorials/tutorial-getting-started](../../tutorials/tutorial-getting-started.md).

### Starting with a bot template

Bot templates are bots built by our team. Each template was made for a certain type of business and handles its most common use cases. They're a great way to get started on your own bot, or to learn more about how certain things can be built on our platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an existing bot already and you just want to add a specific use case, you can do so with a functional flow template. Read more about those here.

## 7 ‚Äì Zendesk ticket creation flow

We wrote a [great article](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/integrations/human-offloading-live-chat/creating-a-zendesk-support-ticket) on how to create a Zendesk ticket integration, but how do you set up your bot so it can collect all those user details to create a ticket? Easy, just download the Zendesk ticket creation flow!

This bot template allows your bot to collect the user info needed to create a ticket using [input validation dialogs](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/bot-answers/dialog-state/user-input-bot-dialog), then confirms with the user if the information is correct before sending it to Zendesk. All you have to do is fill in your own Zendesk login details and off you go!
