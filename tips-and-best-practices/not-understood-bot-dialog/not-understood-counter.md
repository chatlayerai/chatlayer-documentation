# Not understood counter

Instead of displaying the same `not understood` message over and over to the user, you can create a counter to show different kinds of messages. For example, when the bot doesn't understand the user for the two first times, it displays the following:

"Sorry, I didn't get that. Can you please rephrase?" 

Finally, if the bot can't understand again a third time, it shows the user a different message, including a way to get help:

"Sorry, I can't understand. Perhaps you'd like to talk to my colleague instead?"

Or 

"Sorry, I can't understand. Perhaps you'd like to email us instead?"

You can create this message structure by introducing a counter. Learn how in this article.

## 1. Change the dialog type

Click on the 'not understood' bot dialog and change the type to 'Go To'

## 2. Set the conditions in the Go To-dialog

Now we are going to set the conditions for the Go To-dialog.

For the first condition, you want to check if the previous bot dialog is different from the 'not understood message' dialog. To do so, refer to the previous bit dialog by using the variable `internal.previousDialogstate.id` . Then select `not equals` in the drop down menu in the middle. For the value on the right, you can leave this field empty for now and fill it in later. 

Under `Go to`, create a new `bot message` and name it 'not understood message'. A new dialog will automatically be made once you hit enter.

Make sure you add the variable `not_understood_counter` here to make sure that the counter starts when the bot does not understand for the first time:

Next, click on the blue `+ sign` to create a second condition. You now want to check if the `not understood` was already shown 2 times in a row. If so, you want to show a different bot dialog, called 'Not understood 3 times in a row'.

The final condition \(under `Else`\) is where you need to add an [increment ](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/bot-answers/settings/secure-variables-gdpr#incrementing-variable-counter)for the `not_understood_counter` variable. This way, the bot will automatically increase the counter with one.

Add the following text in the value field: `{not_understood_counter|increment}`

## 4. Write the bot messages

This is what you'll see after you have saved the `Go To` dialog:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28476%29.png)

Keep in mind: the dialog named `Not understood message` is the first message users will see when the bot doesn't understand. The dialog named `Not understood 3 times in a row` will be shown when the bot didn't understand for the 3rd time. 

Fill in text for both dialogs. Here's some inspiration:

`Not understood message`= "Sorry, I didn't get that. Can you please rephrase?" 

`Not understood 3 times in a row` = "Sorry, I can't understand. Perhaps you'd like to talk to my colleague instead?"

## 5. Fill in the bot id 

Let's go back to the `Not understood message` bot dialog. Open this dialog and then copy the bot ID in your browser's URL field ‚Äì it's the series of number that come after `/dialogstate/`:

Now go back to your `Go to` dialog that you just created and fill in the bot id in the field on the right:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28470%29.png)

And that's it, all done! You just created a user-friendly way of telling the user the bot didn't understand üëè
