# Not understood bot dialog

Whenever an intent is not recognized above your [threshold](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/understanding-users/natural-language-processing-nlp/settings), the bot will refer to 'not understood'. This is a standard bot dialog which can be found in every bot. 

Just giving the user the message 'Sorry I did not understand that', can be quite short and not a great user experience. There are several ways on how to improve your user experience for the 'not understood' bot dialog:

* Create a [counter ](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/tips-and-best-practices/not-understood-bot-dialog/not-understood-counter)where, after a certain amount of times the user sees a different 'not understood' message than the first message.
* Show the [previous bot dialog](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/tips-and-best-practices/not-understood-bot-dialog/go-to-previous-bot-dialog) after the 'not understood' message is shown.
* A specific 'not understood' message per [intent below the NLP threshold. ](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/tips-and-best-practices/not-understood-bot-dialog/intent-recognition-below-threshold)
* Create a [google search](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/tips-and-best-practices/not-understood-bot-dialog/not-understood-google-search) for 'not understood' messages.
