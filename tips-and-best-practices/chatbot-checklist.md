# Conversation Design checklist

Here are some tips and tricks for building clever bots and offering customers the best possible user experience:

| Your bot:                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Introduces itself and the organisation                                 | _Hi, welcome to Bot Trains. I'm Choo Choo, your virtual assistant 👋_                                                                                  |
| Clearly states what it can do                                          | _I can help you book a ticket, check train times, or find the perfect destination for your next trip!_                                                 |
| Takes turns with the user, instead of bombarding them with information | <p>Bot: <em>“How can I help you?"</em></p><p>User: <em>“I want to book a ticket.”</em></p><p>Bot: <em>“Sure, where do you want to go?”</em></p>        |
| Offers alternative ways of support if it can't help the user           | <p><em>Sorry, our agents are currently unavailable. Perhaps you'd like to email us your question instead? hello@bottrains.com</em></p><p><em></em></p> |
| End the conversation in a clear way                                    | _Glad I could help. Bye bye_ 👋                                                                                                                        |
| Uses empathy                                                           | <p>User: <em>“Help my card got stolen!”</em> </p><p>Bot: <em>“Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Let me help you."</em></p>                             |
| Never uses ALL CAPS                                                    | It comes across as very aggressive – LIKE YOUR BOT IS SHOUTING AT THE USER                                                                             |

| Greets a returning user by their name                            | _Hello Beyonce, welcome back!_                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has a well-defined personality and voice that matches your brand | <p>General bot greeting: <em>“Hello, I’m your bot assistent.”</em></p><p>Formal company bot: <em>“Hello, Ms. Carter. How may I help you today?”</em></p><p>Funky company bot: <em>“Hey B, nice to see you again! What’s up?”</em></p> |
| Uses emojis if/when appropriate                                  | <p>Good: "Get in, we're going shopping 🛍"</p><p>Bad: "Sorry you lost your bank card 😂"</p>                                                                                                                                          |
| Collects user feedback about the conversation                    | <p>"Before you go, how was this experience for you?"</p><ul><li>Great!</li><li>Not so great...</li></ul>                                                                                                                              |
