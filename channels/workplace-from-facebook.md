Clicking the "Message" button will allow the user to start a conversation

### Using email addresses

The Chatlayer.ai Workplace app has access to a Workplace user's email address. When you've connected your bot to the Workplace channel, you can use the variable {email} in your flows, which will be filled with the user's e-mail address. Read more about using variables on our platform [here](../tutorials/tutorial-conditional-flow-navigation.md).

### Uninstalling

If you want to disconnect your bot from Workplace, go to the Admin Panel, click on your bot integration, and click on Uninstall.
