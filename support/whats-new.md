## October 2020 Release

### Bot import/export \(in beta\)

Save a copy of your bot in an export. The export contains:

* NLP
  * Intents
  * Expressions
  * Entities
* Bot dialogs
  * Flows
  * Messages and translations
  * Variables

The export does not contain:

* Conversation history
* Analytics
* Channel settings

Exporting a bot will result in a JSON file that you can download to your computer.

This JSON file can be imported again to overwrite a bot with the data that is in the JSON file.

### Sorting

You can now change the order of buttons, quick replies, carousel items and go to's using drag and drop.
