# Billing & subscription

Based on which contract you will have with Chatlayer, you will have access to certain features and have a volume included with your subscription.

This page is meant to give an overview of the different parameters that form your Chatlayer subscription.

## Conversations

A conversation starts with a first message being sent, either by the bot or by the user. Chatlayer starts counting a new conversation when there is **no interaction between your bot and a user for at least 15 minutes.**

If the user continues the conversation on another channel, this is considered a new conversation.

Conversations where the bot sends a message, but the user does not send a message are counted. These conversations will be included in the Analytics dashboards, but not in the [Conversations](../bot-answers/user-messages.md) table.

## Features

Some features are only included in some packs. For example, the following features are only in the Enterprise & Corporate plans:

* [Team roles & bot access](../organization-management/access-control/)
* [NLP Improve](../understanding-users/natural-language-processing-nlp/nlp-dashboard-and-nlp-improve.md)
* [Salesforce Service Cloud integration](../integrations/human-offloading-live-chat/salesforce-service-cloud.md)
* [Offloading webhook](../integrations/human-offloading-live-chat/offloading-webhook.md)
