# Team members, roles & bot access

In the module ''Platform users' you can add or remove users from your account.

Users that don't have an account yet will receive an activation email. Users that already belong to another Chatlayer.ai account will be able to switch between accounts, using the icon on the top right of the platform.

## Team roles & bot access

{% hint style="info" %}
Team roles & bot access is only available to enterprise users. Want to upgrade? [Get in touch](../support/get-in-touch.md)!

Chatlayer.ai has a role-based access system that allows you to restrict some bots for only some users, and give specific rights per bot.

### Team roles

A user can either be an admin or a member.

**Admins** have access to all bots and create and delete team members.

**Members** can only access OPEN bots or RESTRICTED bots they have access to. They cannot create or delete new team members.

### Bot access

Bots can either be OPEN or RESTRICTED. An OPEN bot can be accessed by all team members. RESTRICTED bots can only be accessed by Admins and approved Members.

You can choose the access to your bot while you're creating the bot:

Or in the settings of your bot:

A RESTRICTED bot will have a "Bot access" tab in the settings. On this page you can configure which team members have access to the bot.

A member can have two types permissions to a RESTRICTED bot:

* **Edit:** the member can change all intents, bot dialogs and settings
* **Read-only:** the member can view the bot, but cannot change anything

Your access level to a bot can be seen on the "My Bots" overview page:
