# Settings

## Status

Click the status slider to temporarily disable the bot. The message configured under the `bot disabled` bot dialog will be shown. Read more about the `bot disabled` bot dialog [here](https://docs.chatlayer.ai/bot-answers/dialog-state#bot-disabled). 

## Maximum message length

Chatbots work best with short and concise messages. To avoid that messages that are too long are not understood, a maximum message length can be configured. Whenever a message is &gt; the characters stated in these settings, the bot will automatically go to a bot dialog of your choice. A bot message with text like: 'I am sorry, I work best with shorter messages. Could you please rephrase that?' is recommended for a good user experience. 

## Botflow URL
