# Translations

The 'Translations' module is used to manage translations for multilingual bots. Find more information on how to configure your multilingual bot here:

{% page-ref page="../../understanding-users/multilanguage-bots.md" %}

This module automatically gathers all the strings that have to be translated or are language-dependent in other ways, like URLs. This includes all messages, random messages, button labels, carousel titles subtitles, URLs ...

You can filter on each column and combine filters.

To edit a translation, first click the Edit button of a row. The displayed text will change into editable text boxes. Now enter the proper translation. To save the translation, click on the Save button.
