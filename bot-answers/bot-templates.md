# Bot templates

When you create a new bot you can choose between starting from scratch, or starting with a template. The template bots are bots built by our expert Conversation Design team and contain pre-built flows around a specific use case. You can add these bots to your account to get inspiration, learn about the possibilities of Chatlayer, or just to experiment with the platform.

We have a long list of templates we still want to build, covering new industries and use cases. Do you want to request a new bot template? [Get in touch](../support/get-in-touch.md) with us!
