# Users

The Users page has two tabs: Users and Activity

### Users

This graph shows the total amount of users, the amount of new users and the amount of returning users.

With the different coloured checkboxes, you can toggle the total, returning or new users for a different overview.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use this information to see trends overtime. That you are missing some users on a weekly basis may not be an issue, but if you see a trend of decreasing users over a few months it may be time to investigate why users are not using the bot as much.
{% endhint %}

### Activity

Activity shows, per hour, when your users are most active. This can be helpful to discover trends and act accordingly.
