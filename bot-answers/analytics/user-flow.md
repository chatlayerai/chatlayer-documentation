Every time a user starts a new session, all of the bot dialogs they run through are counted and summed up to form these analytics. You can also see where users dropped out of the chatbot flow.

Every time a user says something for the first time, or after an interval of 15 minutes of silence, it counts as a new **session**.
{% endhint %}
