# Conversations

Here you can see all users shown in a user table. By starting to type in the Filter text boxes, you can filter conversations based on first name, last name or language.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the conversation history tab, each row corresponds to a conversation. It is possible for one user to have multiple conversations, and thus multiple rows in that table.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Conversations that will not be shown in this table:**

* The test conversations you had with your bot in the "**test your bot**" window will not be shown in the conversations tab. These conversations also don't count towards the number of conversations used in the pricing
* **Empty conversations** that do not contain any message from the user to the bot will not be shown in the conversations tab. These conversations do count towards the number of conversations used in the pricing.
{% endhint %}

Select a user row to see the conversation that took place between this user and your bot. You will see a timestamp for each message and in which bot dialog the message was sent.

#### Voice and phone conversations

Conversations through a voice channel will include both an audio file and transcripts of what was said by the user and your bot.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Conversations with our voice bots will be automatically recorded. Please make sure you inform your user about this in your voice bot flow \(if the user hasn't given their explicit consent yet\) to obey privacy laws.
